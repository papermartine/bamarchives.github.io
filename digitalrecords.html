        <p>It saves server space (which translates into time and money) to remove folders and files that are no longer being used. Here are places to look for files and folders that can be deleted.</p>
        <p>Download folder &rarr; This contains anything you've downloaded over time, installers, videos, jpegs, etc. Please remove anything that is not currently pertinent.</p>
        <p>H:/ &rarr; This is your Home directory. If there is anything here that is pertinent to the department, please move that data to the F:/ and delete from your H:/. If it is no longer relevant to your day to day job, please delete.</p> 
        <p>F:/ &rarr; This is the departmental share. Please work with members of your department to   determine what files are no longer relevant and remove them.</p>
        <p>P:/ &rarr; The Public folders contain the largest portion of outdated files. This is also the area that is most susceptible to malware infection due to the sheer volume of files and the minimal security restrictions in place that allow these directories to remain "Public."</p>

      <h4 class="title">Consider deleting these files</h4>
        <p>Old files no longer needed (a good rule of thumb is to sort files by last date accessed and to delete those not looked at in the last 18 months).</p>
        <p>Drafts.</p>
        <p>Multi-media files where copies are available elsewhere (these take up HUGE amounts of space).</p>
        <p>Duplicates.</p>
